# Line-Inspection

This project aims to build a robot that can travel on electric wire lines and inspect whether any damage is present or not. The main challenge here is to cross the electric poles during the traversel. For that the design of robot has been implemented using 10 DC motors and 14 Servo motors. These have been controlled in such a way so that the robot can cross the pole.
